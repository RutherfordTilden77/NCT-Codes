Your lack of national profile? Or your failure to make inroads in the South? Regardless, Democratic leaders are not happy with your performance.<p><p>It’s likely a more mainstream candidate will be nominated in 1980, and, after two failed outsiders in a row, it’s highly possible that the Democrats will look seriously at reforming the primary process to avoid a similar disaster in future.
