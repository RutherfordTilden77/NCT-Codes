A Kansas native, Dole was wounded in battle in the Italian theater during World War II, returning home to a hero's welcome before successfully seeking election to the Senate in 1968. Dole is regarded as an experienced legislator and shrewd negotiator, taking on a succession of senior posts in the Senate including chairing the Senate Finance Committee. He also served as Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976, losing to the Carter-Mondale ticket.<p>Dole was initially seen by most Washington insiders as a fiercely partisan figure, but has softened this image in recent years.

You have won the 1988 election.</h3><p>You can’t help but smile for the cameras at your victory rally, as most of the states that voted twice for Reagan are now called for you, confirming the Republican lock on the presidency into the next decade. The Democrats recovered some ground in the Northeast, and the farm crisis definitely put parts of the Midwest out of reach, but other than that, you’re pretty happy with the way the electoral map is looking. Dukakis gives you a quick concession call. He sounds despondent, and is thinking of leaving national politics altogether after this. You wish him all the best, whatever happens in future.<p>Just after midnight, Bill Brock lets you know that Congress has stayed blue. A tough fight over the budget deficit looms, and there are tricky negotiations with the Soviets to look forward to as well. There will be a lot of challenges over the next four years. Good luck, President Dole.","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Sorry. You have lost the 1988 election.</h3><p>This was the kind of result the pollsters were predicting back in the summer, when Dukakis had a seventeen-point lead over you, and while the polls narrowed close to election day, it was never going to be enough. Lee Atwater claims that if you’d agreed to go with his idea about making an ad about prison furloughs, that would have tipped the balance, while others argue that Robertson spoiled the ballot, or that the public were simply tired of Republican control of the executive branch. 1988 will go down in history as a classic realignment election, as Dukakis has swept into the White House, while his party has strengthened its grip on Congress. As for you, you’re looking forward to your new job as Senate Minority Leader, opposing Dukakis’ initiatives on healthcare and taxes every step of the way. It’s time to get back to work, Bob Dole.<p>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>Too Close To Call</h3><p>This isn't the result that anyone was expecting, as no candidate has achieved a majority of electoral college votes. Your next steps are unclear. At the moment, however, it's likely that the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives will move to elect your opponent president, as they have a greater number of state delegations. Dukakis will take office as a lame duck president, while you can continue to oppose his agenda in the Senate. Let's hope the 1992 election is more conventional than this.<p>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":153,"fields":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Dukakis","election":15,"party":"Democrat","state":"Massachusetts","priority":1,"description":"tank man<br><br>","color_hex":"#0000ff","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":0,"image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Michael_Dukakis_1988_DNC_%28cropped%29.jpg/720px-Michael_Dukakis_1988_DNC_%28cropped%29.jpg?20230223192348.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":154,"fields":{"first_name":"Lenora","last_name":"Fulani/Others","election":15,"party":"Green","state":"Connecticut","priority":1,"description":"spoiler candidate","color_hex":"#0bd022","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":0,"image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Ralph_nader_portrait.jpg/640px-Ralph_nader_portrait.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":155,"fields":{"first_name":"Pat","last_name":"Robertson","election":15,"party":"Independent","state":"Utah","priority":1,"description":"other spoiler","color_hex":"#eea917","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":0,"image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Pat_Robertson_speaks_about_the_national_deficit_%28cropped%29.jpg/640px-Pat_Robertson_speaks_about_the_national_deficit_%28cropped%29.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":496,"fields":{"first_name":"Jack","last_name":"Kemp","election":15,"party":"Republican","state":"New York","priority":1,"description":"<p>Jack Kemp is a Representative from New York, and a former professional football player.
