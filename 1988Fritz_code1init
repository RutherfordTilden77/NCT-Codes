A few months ago, your advisors were assuring you that you were sure to beat Al Haig in a landslide after his gaffes took over the news cycle. This is a fine margin of victory, however.

Was it simply the economy? Hart's public scandals? Or Lee Iacocca's third-party effort spoiling the ballot? You ponder these questions, but find little solace as you prepare to give your concession speech. Haig will have a Republican Senate on his side, but the Democratic House will likely work to temper Haig's worst policy instincts.
