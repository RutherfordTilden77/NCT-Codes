If there’s one lesson the pundits will take from this evening, it’ll be the importance of not underestimating the Maverick. You’ve rattled the nerves of the establishment in both parties. Republicans are pleasantly surprised that you handily overcame an eleven-point deficit in the polls to beat Gore, while Democrats nationwide are astonished at Gore’s failure to capitalize on the healthy economy, and Clinton’s relative popularity. The DNC will be asking some tough questions after this loss, that’s for sure. You’ll have to tread carefully during your first term. You’ve promised a more hawkish American presence abroad, and a more confrontational approach to Iraq and Russia. Your challenge now will be to deliver on this rhetoric without getting the country embroiled in a new Cold War. At home, you’ll work with Congress to pass generous tax cuts.
